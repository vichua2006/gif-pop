# GIF Pop

Collect and save your favourite GIFs to never lose them again! A lightweight Electron app for managing your personal GIF collection. Add your own GIFs, jpg, png as local files, organize with custom names for ease of search, and quickly search & paste them anywhere using a global keyboard shortcut.

Intended usage in mind was to be able to use [WeChat Stickers](https://sticker.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/mmemoticonwebnode-bin/pages/home) in other messaging apps, but feel free to use it for anything you want.

**NOTE: clipboard pasting is currently only supported on Windows**
